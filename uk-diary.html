for this year. It will include guides on BRP, GP, bank cards, and perhaps even a Vlog? (Maybe)</blockquote><span id="more"></span><div class="note warning"><p>This post was translated from my Chinese blog post with the aid of ChatGpt.</p></div><h1 id="Flights"><a href="#Flights" class="headerlink" title="Flights"></a>Flights</h1><p>I booked Finnair AY088 + AY1373 flights, which included a layover at Helsinki Airport in Finland before landing at Edinburgh Airport. The entire journey takes approximately 15 hours.</p><h2 id="Shanghai-Pudong-International-Airport-Departure"><a href="#Shanghai-Pudong-International-Airport-Departure" class="headerlink" title="Shanghai Pudong International Airport - Departure"></a>Shanghai Pudong International Airport - Departure</h2><p>The departure time for the first leg of the flight was at 10:20 am. I arrived at the airport around 7:30 am, and I recommend arriving at least 3 hours in advance. The check-in and baggage drop-off lines can be quite long, especially if you are flying with an airline like Finnair that is strict about cabin baggage. They might ask you to repack your luggage on the spot, which can be time-consuming.</p><h3 id="Check-in"><a href="#Check-in" class="headerlink" title="Check-in"></a>Check-in</h3><p>At the check-in counter, airline staff will weigh your cabin baggage. Only bags that are within the weight limit are allowed for check-in. If your cabin baggage is overweight, you’ll have to open it, redistribute the weight, and then get it weighed again. I had previously weighed my luggage at home, and I had one 20-inch cabin suitcase and one small backpack, totaling 8kg. The staff visually estimated my bag’s weight and allowed me to proceed without actually weighing it (lucky me!). Some heavier items (e.g., power banks) can be placed in your pockets temporarily to meet weight restrictions.</p><p>After that, I waited in line for approximately half an hour to reach the check-in counter. I had a checked baggage allowance of two pieces, each weighing up to 23kg. In reality, they allow a slight overweight, like 23.5kg is generally fine. If your cabin baggage is significantly overweight, consider purchasing additional baggage allowance in advance; it’s much cheaper than buying it at the airport.</p><h3 id="Security-Check"><a href="#Security-Check" class="headerlink" title="Security Check"></a>Security Check</h3><p>Next is the security check. You’ll need to scan a QR code and complete a customs declaration for departure. After filling it out, you’ll receive a QR code, which the staff at the entrance will scan. If you have family accompanying you to the airport, this is where you’ll have to say goodbye. Inside, another staff member will scan your QR code, and then it’s the usual X-ray machines and security checks. We won’t cover the boarding process here.</p><h3 id="In-Flight-Experience"><a href="#In-Flight-Experience" class="headerlink" title="In-Flight Experience"></a>In-Flight Experience</h3><p>I must compliment Finnair’s aircraft. They have screens on the seats where you can watch live broadcasts from two cameras: one on the belly of the plane and another on the tail. During my awake hours, I spent about half the time staring at this live feed. The other half, I was playing Angry Birds (haha). During the first leg of the flight, they served two meals, which were average in taste. They also offered a Finnish specialty, blueberry juice. Unfortunately, my brain malfunctioned, and I forgot how to say <code>blueberries</code> in English…</p><p>Regarding protective measures, as the first leg of the journey was departing from China, most passengers were only wearing masks. Some passengers put on full protective gear, goggles, or face shields before landing. A few even wore gloves, but I don’t recommend gloves as your hands might sweat, making it difficult to provide fingerprints at immigration. If you choose to wear protective gear, consider wearing lighter clothing underneath. I initially wore a down jacket and felt like I was melting inside. Onboard, they also provide a small packet of heavily scented hand sanitizer.</p><h2 id="Helsinki-Airport-Layover"><a href="#Helsinki-Airport-Layover" class="headerlink" title="Helsinki Airport - Layover"></a>Helsinki Airport - Layover</h2><h3 id="Transit"><a href="#Transit" class="headerlink" title="Transit"></a>Transit</h3><p>During the layover, follow the signs and the crowd. After descending a flight of stairs, you’ll need to go through security again, and your cabin baggage will be inspected once more. If you’re wearing protective gear, you can usually keep it on, and the staff will let you pass through the security gate. My layover for this flight was over two hours, which was quite comfortable. Some duty-free shops were open at the airport if you’re bored and want to take a look. The airport was relatively empty, and most foreigners were wearing masks. Overall, it felt quite safe.</p><h3 id="Boarding"><a href="#Boarding" class="headerlink" title="Boarding"></a>Boarding</h3><p>Boarding is done in groups, and your group will be indicated on your ticket. Wait until they call your group, and then queue up, maintaining a 2-meter distance from others, following the footprint markers on the ground. Before boarding, I recommend staying hydrated and using the restroom as the second flight carries a higher risk. The plane will serve beverages as usual, and passengers tend to remove their masks to eat and drink, which can be risky. If you’re traveling with friends on the same flight, consider selecting seats together in advance.</p><h2 id="Edinburgh-Airport-Arrival"><a href="#Edinburgh-Airport-Arrival" class="headerlink" title="Edinburgh Airport - Arrival"></a>Edinburgh Airport - Arrival</h2><p>The second flight tends to land ahead of schedule, usually about half an hour early. After landing, you’ll climb a flight of stairs and navigate through the airport to reach immigration. Immigration in Scotland is relatively relaxed; they rarely check your luggage. At the immigration counter, the officer will inspect your passport and ask you some questions. Just answer truthfully. They will stamp your passport with an entry stamp. I recommend checking if this stamp is legible as you’ll need to show it when collecting your BRP (Biometric Residence Permit) at your university. After clearing immigration, proceed to the baggage claim area. Once you’ve collected your luggage, you can exit the airport. The entire process, from exiting the plane to leaving the airport, took me about 40 minutes.</p><h2 id="Glasgow-Airport-Pickup"><a href="#Glasgow-Airport-Pickup" class="headerlink" title="Glasgow - Airport Pickup"></a>Glasgow - Airport Pickup</h2><p>Originally, I had arranged to share a ride with a friend, but my friend bailed on me. So, I ended up booking a Chinese airport pickup service, which cost £90, roughly the same as an Uber. I found the pickup service on a WeChat public account, which acted as an intermediary and charged a £20 fee. If you know someone in the UK, I recommend asking them for recommendations and contacting the driver directly. The journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow’s student accommodation took about an hour. If you’re landing at Glasgow Airport, it’s even simpler. After exiting the airport, just take a taxi. It’s about a 10-minute ride from Glasgow Airport to the Kelvin Court Residences.</p><h1 id="Checking-In"><a href="#Checking-In" class="headerlink" title="Checking-In"></a>Checking-In</h1><p>I stayed at Kelvin Court, which is part of the Unite Student group. Before checking in, you need to provide your estimated arrival time on the apartment’s app called <code>MyUnite.</code> If, like me, you arrive late when the reception is closed, you can knock on the brightly lit window on the right side, and a staff member will come to open the door. Inside, you’ll need to hand over your passport to the staff. After some clicking and typing, they’ll give you an envelope containing your room key and mailbox key. I recommend checking if the keys are inside; in my case, they were missing the mailbox key. I had to go back to the reception a few days later to get it. The bald receptionist was very helpful and even walked me to the entrance of my block. Additionally, the university provided some snack packs at the apartment during check-in. The receptionist will give you one, and it contains quite a variety of items, including biscuits, juice, chips, pasta, milk, jam, canned goods, and more (enough to be a happy couch potato for a few days).</p><h1 id="Collecting-BRP-x2F-Campus-Card"><a href="#Collecting-BRP-x2F-Campus-Card" class="headerlink" title="Collecting BRP&#x2F;Campus Card"></a>Collecting BRP&#x2F;Campus Card</h1><h2 id="Booking-an-Appointment"><a href="#Booking-an-Appointment" class="headerlink" title="Booking an Appointment"></a>Booking an Appointment</h2><p>If you specified your CAS’s <code>Additional Collection Location Code (ACL) for Biometric Residence Permit delivery</code> when applying for your visa, your BRP (Biometric Residence Permit) will be sent to the university. Once the university receives your BRP, they will send you an email reminding you to book an appointment to collect it. I recommend booking the BRP collection appointment only after receiving this email; otherwise, you might make a wasted trip. You can book your appointment at the following website, using your university account to log in and select a time slot.</p><a class="btn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://frontdoor.spa.gla.ac.uk/AppointmentBookingService/NotLoggedIn.aspx?Page=FastBook.aspx&Query=%3fMeetingTypeId%3d110"><i class="fa fa-home fa-fw"></i>Book an Appointment</a><p>After booking, you will receive an email with details of your BRP collection time and location.

However, the interest rate for British pounds in Chinese banks is negligible and can be ignored. Additionally, while abroad, you may receive risk control calls from Bank of China, which could potentially lead to your card being locked. Therefore, I decided to open a local Scottish bank account as well as a Starling online bank credit card.</p><p>Starling, like Monzo, is an online bank with no physical branches. To deposit money into your account, you’ll need to visit a post office. These accounts are suitable for everyday use, and you can keep a small amount of pounds in them for daily expenses, minimizing potential losses in case of fraud. I chose Starling mainly because of its aesthetics; I found Monzo’s fluorescent orange card too striking, and I personally prefer Starling’s blue.</p><p>The process of opening an online bank account is relatively straightforward. Download the app and follow the steps; I won’t go into detail here. Instead, I’ll focus on the process of opening an account with the Bank of Scotland.</p><h2 id="Printing-a-Bank-Letter"><a href="#Printing-a-Bank-Letter" class="headerlink" title="Printing a Bank Letter"></a>Printing a Bank Letter</h2><p>You can download a Bank Letter from the University of Glasgow’s My Glasgow online platform in PDF format.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sharepoint.gla.ac.uk/students/myglasgow/">My Glasgow</a></p><ul><li>Log in to My Glasgow.</li><li>Click on <code>My Student Center</code> in the right sidebar.</li><li>Under <code>My Academic Record</code> in the top left corner, click on <code>Bank and Certifying Letters.</code></li><li>Choose <code>Bank Letter.</code></li><li>The university provides a list of nearby bank branches.

They will inform you of the registration date, location, and any specific instructions. This appointment time cannot be changed, so if you can’t make it on the scheduled day, you’ll need to reschedule. Additionally, due to the need for social distancing, the number of daily registrations is limited. For example, I sent an email in early May, and my registration was scheduled for August.</p><p>When you go for registration, make sure to bring the following documents:</p><ul><li>Passport</li><li>BRP</li><li>The two papers that were sent along with your BRP when you applied for your visa (BRP Letter)</li><li>Police registration form, which you can fill out and print.

You can see them for general health concerns, but for emergencies, it’s best to call 999 for an ambulance.</p><p>I recommend registering with a GP after arriving in the UK, especially since you’ve already paid a substantial healthcare fee (£400+) through the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) when applying for your visa. After registration, you can get prescriptions from your GP and collect medications for free at pharmacies, except in England where there’s a £9.15 prescription fee.</p><p>You can find basic information about GPs near you by entering your postcode on the following websites:</p><p>For Scotland:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/scotlands-service-directory/gp-practices">Find a GP in Scotland</a></p><p>For England:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-GP">Find a GP in England</a></p><p>I recommend choosing a GP close to your residence rather than the university’s GP. Getting medical care when you’re unwell is much more convenient if your GP is nearby. You can also check Google Maps for reviews of different GP practices to avoid any potential issues.</p><p>After selecting a GP from the websites above, you can visit the GP’s website to find out what information you need to register. As an example, for the GP I registered with, I had to download three forms from their website: GPR form, New Patient Questionnaire, and Ethnicity Form. After filling them out and printing them, I took these forms along with my passport&#x2F;BRP to the GP’s reception to complete the registration.

Note that you can only pick up items in-store at the moment.</li><li><strong>Home Bargain</strong>: Another discount store where you can often discover inexpensive, decent-quality items.</li><li><strong>Sainsbury’s</strong>: A large supermarket with a wide selection.</li><li><strong>M&amp;S Simply Food</strong>: A high-end supermarket; I usually go there for strawberry tarts!</li><li><strong>Aijia Chinese Supermarket</strong>: A large Chinese supermarket, but I haven’t been inside yet.</li><li><strong>Boots</strong>: A large Boots store with a wide range of cosmetics and daily necessities.</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="Useful-Apps"><a href="#Useful-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Useful Apps"></a>Useful Apps</h1><p>Here are some apps I installed after coming to the UK:</p><ul><li><strong>UNiDAYS</strong>: Offers various student discounts, including a six-month Amazon Prime Student membership.</li><li><strong>Railcard</strong>: Provides discounts on train tickets, saving you one-third of the fare each time.</li><li><strong>Trainline</strong>: A handy app for booking train tickets.</li><li><strong>Uber</strong>: For taxi services.</li><li><strong>Google Maps</strong>: Prevents you from getting lost.</li><li><strong>PayPal</strong>: Useful for online payments, especially on eBay.</li><li><strong>Supermarket Apps</strong>:<ul><li><strong>Boots</strong>: Earn points for cashback; I recommend activating your student membership in-store with your student ID for a 10% discount on purchases.</li><li><strong>Lidl</strong>: Their point system isn’t the best; points reset monthly, and you need to accumulate £100 to get a voucher.</li><li><strong>Morrisons More</strong>: Similar to Lidl, the point system can be slow.</li><li><strong>Clubcard (Tesco)</strong>: Collect points for discounts; it takes £150 of spending to get a £1.50 voucher.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Online Shopping</strong>:<ul><li><strong>eBay</strong>: Similar to Taobao, offering affordable items.</li><li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Similar to JD.com.</li><li><strong>AliExpress</strong>: Similar to Taobao Global, but I don’t use it much.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Red Scarf</strong>: A guide app for international students in the UK, with more detailed information than what I’ve provided here.</li><li><strong>BiliBili Helper</strong>: A VPN for accessing BiliBili in China; it’s free but has ads, which I can tolerate since I don’t use it much.</li><li><strong>XiaoHongShu (Little Red Book)</strong>: A platform popular among international students for sharing information, including many guides and recipes.</li></ul><h1 id="Shopping-Tips"><a href="#Shopping-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Shopping Tips"></a>Shopping Tips</h1><p>When it comes to furniture and appliances, try to buy second-hand items whenever possible as they are much cheaper. For instance, here are some things I bought after arriving in the UK:</p><ul><li><strong>Humidifier</strong>: Highly recommended, as the air indoors can get very dry due to central heating. I bought mine on eBay.</li><li><strong>Coat Hangers</strong>: I got mine on Amazon for around £10, but you can find them for as little as £5 at the £1 shops.</li><li><strong>Drying Rack</strong>: I bought a second-hand one; you can also check IKEA. Since UK accommodations typically lack balconies, clothes are often dried indoors near radiators.</li><li><strong>Mini Washing Machine</strong>: Laundry in student accommodations can be expensive (around £3.30 per wash and £1.50 for drying). I bought a semi-automatic washing machine for about £50 and, in the long run, it’s more economical. You can find similar deals on eBay or AliExpress.</li><li><strong>Water Filter Jug</strong>: Just for peace of mind; Scotland generally has good tap water.</li><li><strong>Shower Head with Filter</strong>: Supposedly prevents hair loss; I can’t confirm its effectiveness.</li><li><strong>Rice Cooker</strong>: A must-have for rice lovers.</li><li><strong>UK Power Strip</strong>: Power outlets are always in short supply.</li><li><strong>Laundry Basket</strong>: Affordable at Home Bargain.</li><li><strong>Yoga Mat</strong>: Bought for £5.99 at Home Bargain.</li><li><strong>Trolley for Grocery Shopping</strong>: Bought for £7.99 at Home Bargain, though it’s often out of stock.</li><li><strong>Isopropyl Alcohol</strong>: Bought a 5L bottle on Amazon for £13. It’s great for disinfecting.</li><li><strong>Dirty Clothes Basket</strong>: Very affordable at Home Bargain.</li><li><strong>Oven Gloves</strong>: Found them at a £1 shop for £1 or £2.</li><li><strong>Baking Tray</strong>: Also found at a £1 shop.</li><li><strong>Plastic Basin</strong>: Bought at a £1 shop for £1 each.</li><li><strong>Cutting Board, Knife, and Various Condiments</strong>: Chinese supermarkets have them, but they can be a bit pricier.</li></ul><p>When shopping for bed linens, note that UK student accommodations often have <code>3/4 double</code> beds. I recommend buying double-sized bedding, as single-sized ones can be a bit small.</p><ul><li><strong>Duvet Cover</strong>: A cover for your duvet.</li><li><strong>Duvet Cover Set</strong>: Includes duvet cover and pillowcases.</li><li><strong>Pillowcases</strong>: For your pillows.</li><li><strong>Fitted Sheet&#x2F;Flat Sheet</strong>: A fitted sheet has elastic corners, while a flat sheet is more like the standard sheet you’d find in China.</li><li><strong>Pillow</strong>: Pillow inserts.</li><li><strong>Duvet</strong>: Duvet inserts.</li></ul><h1 id="Train-Cards"><a href="#Train-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Train Cards"></a>Train Cards</h1><p>There are various types of train cards in the UK, and most international students typically apply for the 16-25 Railcard, which provides a one-third discount on ticket prices.</p><ul><li><strong>Are you a mature student?</strong>: If you are over 26 years old, select <code>Yes, I am a mature student.</code> If you are over 26, you can only buy a one-year card.</li><li>If you are under 26, you can choose between a one-year card for £30 and a three-year card for £70. However, since most students are on one-year postgraduate courses, the three-year card doesn’t offer much advantage.</li><li>Personally, I find the digital card more convenient than the physical card, which takes one to two weeks to arrive.</li><li>The <code>Promotional code</code> is challenging to come by; I couldn’t find any usable ones.</li><li>When verifying your identity, it’s recommended to choose a passport for convenience, as the information on your Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) may not match exactly.</li><li>After making the payment, you’ll be asked if you want cashback, which is over £16. However, it will automatically sign you up for a membership with the first month free and a £15 monthly subscription fee afterward. I chose the cashback option and canceled the membership after receiving the cashback. It just doesn’t sit right with me to let capitalism off so easily!</li></ul><a class="btn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://secure.railcard.co.uk/purchase/16-25/"><i class="fa fa-home fa-fw"></i>Apply for a 16-25 Railcard</a><h1 id="Sending-Mail-at-the-Post-Office"><a href="#Sending-Mail-at-the-Post-Office" class="headerlink" title="Sending Mail at the Post Office"></a>Sending Mail at the Post Office</h1><p>The efficiency of handling affairs in the UK can lag behind some other countries. There are instances where something that could be resolved online still requires mailing. Moreover, the capitalist post office does have its ways of being expensive. Here’s a story of how I got taken advantage of when I went to the post office:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">I went in and said, &quot;I want to send a letter.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">He said, &quot;Alright, place it on the scale to weigh it, and it should arrive by Monday.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">I thought the cheapest option should take just two to three days, so I said, &quot;OK.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">Then he rapidly typed something on his terminal and said, &quot;It&#x27;s ready; please make the payment.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">I had my Apple Pay ready and nearly placed it on the POS machine, but then I checked the amount: £7.65.</span><br><span class="line">I thought he must have made a mistake and asked, &quot;Is it £7?&quot;</span><br><span class="line">He replied, &quot;Yes, this is the fastest service.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">I thought the fastest service should still be delivered by the next day, right?</span><br><span class="line">So I said, &quot;I want the cheaper option; I&#x27;m not in a hurry.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">Then he told me, &quot;The cheaper option costs just over £3.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">I still felt something was off, but I couldn&#x27;t recall at the moment. So I reluctantly paid the £2 and went home.</span><br><span class="line">It wasn&#x27;t until I got home that I realized the option he offered was for tracked mail and that the one without tracking cost only £1.53.</span><br><span class="line">But even the tracking option didn&#x27;t have much use, and charging an extra pound was ridiculous.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In the UK, mailing services typically have three levels:</p><ul><li><strong>Special Delivery</strong>: The fastest and most expensive, arriving before 9 am the next day.</li><li><strong>1st Class</strong>: First-class mail usually arrives in one to two days.</li><li><strong>2nd Class</strong>: Second-class mail typically arrives in two to three days.</li></ul><p>These services can also be divided into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard</strong>: Basic mail without tracking and no need for the recipient’s signature.</li><li><strong>Signed</strong>: Mail with tracking that requires the recipient’s signature, with a higher cost.</li></ul><p>If you’re not in a hurry, you can tell the postal worker that you want the <code>Standard/Unsigned 2nd Class</code> option to avoid being offered the more expensive <code>Special Delivery</code> option. Here’s a link to check mailing prices:</p><a class="btn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.postoffice.co.uk/price-finder"><i class="fa fa-home fa-fw"></i>Mailing Price Finder</a><p>Additionally, the UK post office supports printing your postage stamps. The prices on their website are clear, and after printing, you can simply stick the postage on your envelope and drop it into the red mailbox. I plan to try this next time.

The old pigeon who just finished exams is back!</p><p>There are four main eyeglasses stores in the UK:</p><ul><li>Specsavers</li><li>Boots Opticians</li><li>Vision Express</li><li>David Clulow (Consider if you’re wealthy; it’s quite expensive)</li></ul><p>I chose Specsavers because it’s the closest to home, and they have an online tool for trying on frames with AR (Augmented Reality). Here’s the official website:</p><a class="btn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.specsavers.co.uk/"><i class="fa fa-home fa-fw"></i>Specsavers</a><p>Here’s the process for getting prescription glasses with frames:</p><ol><li>Click on <code>Book appointment</code> in the upper right corner.</li><li>Enter your postal code to find nearby stores, then click <code>Book online.</code></li><li>Choose <code>Adult eye test.</code></li><li>You’ll be asked if you want a glaucoma test for an additional £10; I didn’t opt for it.</li><li>Select a date and time; at my nearest store, the earliest available was 10 days later.</li><li>Fill in your personal information. If you have an HC2 (NHS optical voucher), select <code>Yes</code> for the last question, <code>Are you entitled to an NHS eye test?</code></li><li>After submitting, you’ll be prompted to fill out a questionnaire. You’ll also receive an email with a link to the questionnaire, which covers your visual habits.</li><li>The day before your appointment, the store will call to confirm your visit and send a confirmation text.</li><li>Arrive promptly on the scheduled day; if you’re more than twenty minutes late, your appointment may be canceled.</li><li>Upon arrival, inform the front desk of your appointment time. They’ll verify your name, address, and whether it’s your first time getting an eye test in the UK.</li><li>Wait in the designated area until the optometrist calls you.</li><li>If you currently wear glasses, the optometrist will begin by checking your current glasses’ prescription.</li><li>Then, you’ll move to a small room with the optometrist, where various instruments will be used:<ul><li>An instrument similar to the one in China for checking small houses but here, you’ll be looking at a hot air balloon.</li><li>Next, you’ll focus on a red dot in the instrument. Be prepared for a sudden bright flash that might catch you off guard.</li><li>Following this, the optometrist will measure your prescription. Your face will be close to the instrument, and you’ll read the letters on a chart. Unlike the Chinese charts, here, each line has multiple letters, and you need to read the last line you can clearly see.</li><li>The optometrist will adjust the lenses using the instrument and ask if things look better, worse, or the same as before.</li><li>They’ll also check for astigmatism by asking which of two pictures appears clearer (one or two).</li><li>Finally, they’ll assess the health of your eyes by shining a light and asking you to look in various directions.</li></ul></li><li>After the eye test, the optometrist will provide you with the results. Then, you’ll proceed to the area where you can choose your frames.</li><li>The staff responsible for frames will give you a small tray. When trying on glasses from the display, place them in the tray. Do not put them back on the shelf; the staff will need to sanitize them.</li><li>If you have an HC2, frames priced at £49 or below are free. For frames priced higher, you’ll need to pay the difference.</li><li>Once you’ve chosen your frames, return the tray to the staff. They may ask if you want additional services, including:<ul><li>Thinning the lenses (the standard cost is £20, but I chose this option because of my high prescription).</li><li>I picked a £69 frame; British frames can be quite unattractive, and it took me a while to find one that was passable.</li><li>After the HC2 discount, I only had to pay £29.70. If you select frames priced at £49 or less and don’t thin the lenses, you can get them for free (capitalism’s wool is there for the taking).</li><li>If you’re getting them for free, the staff might recommend lens coatings, such as anti-reflective, blue light filter, or UV protection.</li><li>Be aware that there might be a tactic involved; the staff could provide you with a final price without explaining what coatings they’re adding. In this case, you’ll need to ask why it’s so expensive; otherwise, you might end up paying more.</li><li>If you don’t want coatings, specify that you only want standard lenses without any additional coatings.</li></ul></li><li>With the eyeglass prescription, you can consider getting glasses from Taobao when you return to China. The style options are much better and probably more fashionable than what you’ll find in the UK.</li><li>After everything is completed, you’ll receive a card with details about when to pick up your glasses. For me, it was a week later, which is quite fast. During pickup, they will make on-the-spot adjustments if necessary.</li></ol><h1 id="Castle-Happy-Card"><a href="#Castle-Happy-Card" class="headerlink" title="Castle Happy Card"></a>Castle Happy Card</h1><p>I highly recommend this card for friends who enjoy visiting castles. It’s called the <code>HISTORIC SCOTLAND MEMBERSHIP,</code> priced at £30 for an annual membership. With this card, you can enjoy unlimited free visits to historic sites in Scotland, including Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, and more. Additionally, you’ll get a 10% discount at the gift shops within these sites. Since the entrance fees for Edinburgh and Stirling Castles are both £15, visiting each of them once already covers the cost. Any subsequent visits to other castles and historic sites become pure enjoyment. Edinburgh Castle has such breathtaking views; I plan to visit it several more times!</p><p>Here’s the registration link:</p><a class="btn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://members.historic-scotland.gov.uk/join?tab=1"><i class="fa fa-home fa-fw"></i>Castle Happy Card Registration</a><p>Once you’re on the website, fill in your personal information for registration. I recommend selecting <code>Direct Debit Annual</code> as the payment method to save 10% on the fee.</p><p>As a member, you’ll receive a magazine that you can choose to receive electronically or in print. After registering, you should receive your membership card and an introductory manual within about three to four days.</p><p>Of course, if you, like me, discover this card just a few days before your planned visit and the card hasn’t arrived yet, you can still enter the castles with the confirmation email you receive.</p><p>Once you have the card, when booking tickets, choose the <code>Scottish Heritage Member Ticket</code> option, and the payment page will show £0.</p><h1 id="To-Be-Continued…"><a href="#To-Be-Continued…" class="headerlink" title="To Be Continued…"></a>To Be Continued…</h1><p>More content to come, but I’ll be delaying it indefinitely. I gave up on registering with the dentist because the materials used for free dental work seem to be black, so I’ll just wait until I’m back in China to deal with it.</p><h1 id="KC-Room-Tour"><a href="#KC-Room-Tour" class="headerlink" title="KC Room Tour"></a>KC Room Tour</h1><p>This might be postponed indefinitely as well. The apartment staff have locked all the doors to vacant rooms, so I can’t access them for filming. I’ll have to wait until my roommates arrive.
